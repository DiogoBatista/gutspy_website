## 1 · Meet the Bristol Scale

Developed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in 1997 by Drs. Ken Heaton and Stephen Lewis, the BSFS classifies stool appearance into **seven distinct types** that mirror how quickly (or slowly) material moves through your colon.

| Type  | Look & Feel (plain-language) | Transit-Time Signal           |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **1** | Hard, separate pellets       | Very slow · constipated       |
| **2** | Lumpy, sausage-shaped        | Moderately slow               |
| **3** | Sausage with cracks          | Slightly slow but near-normal |
| **4** | Smooth, soft “snake”         | Gold-standard · healthy       |
| **5** | Soft blobs, clear edges      | Slightly fast                 |
| **6** | Fluffy pieces, ragged edges  | Fast · mild diarrhoea         |
| **7** | Watery, no solids            | Very fast · severe diarrhoea  |

> **Quick take:** Aim for Type 4 (and sometimes Type 3).\
> Types 1–2 spell sluggish transit and likely constipation; Types 6–7 point to excess speed, fluid loss and potential malabsorption.

## 2 · Why Form Outranks Frequency

You can empty your bowels three times a day or three times a week and still be healthy. **Form, not frequency, tracks colonic transit most accurately.**\
Radiopaque-marker studies show a tight correlation between BSFS scores and whole-gut transit time:

* **Types 1–2:** delayed transit, hard stools, higher risk for haemorrhoids and diverticular disease.
* **Types 6–7:** accelerated transit, fluid loss, possible microbiome disruption.
* **Type 4 (±3):** optimal nutrient absorption, balanced microbiota and the lowest all-cause mortality in large cohort studies.

## 3 · Clinical Credibility in One Glance

The BSFS isn’t just a cute infographic — it has been validated across ages and settings:

* **Adults:** Excellent inter-rater reliability for individual stool ratings.
* **Children:** A child-friendly mBSFS-C version shows solid validity from \~6 years old.
* **Disease stratification:** Baked into Rome IV criteria for IBS sub-typing and widely used in trials for constipation, diarrhoea-predominant IBS and microbiome research.

## 4 · From Toilet → Dashboard: How GutSpy Leverages the Scale

| GutSpy Feature                            | What It Does                                                                                              | Why BSFS Matters                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-tap logging (or photo-AI capture)** | Select your stool type or snap a discreet photo; AI grades it.                                            | Removes guesswork; higher accuracy than memory-based diaries.    |
| **Transit-time trendlines**               | Combines BSFS entries with timestamps to graph personal gut-motility patterns.                            | Detects stealth constipation or post-antibiotic diarrhoea early. |
| **Diet & symptom correlation**            | Overlays stool data with food logs, stress scores and meds.                                               | Helps spot triggers (e.g. sorbitol-rich snacks → Type 6).        |
| **Clinician-ready exports**               | Generates BSFS-coded PDF reports.                                                                         | Saves consultation time; meets research-grade data standards.    |
| **Smart nudges**                          | 7-day rolling average drifting into Types 1–2 or 6–7? GutSpy sends evidence-based tips or flags for care. | Turns passive tracking into preventive action.                   |

## 5 · Reading Your Results — Practical Tips

1. **Look before you flush.** Good lighting and a quick glance are all you need; photos boost precision.
2. **Log consistently at the same time of day** (morning for most) to reduce variability.
3. **Context is king.** A lone Type 6 after spicy take-out is noise; a week-long streak signals a pattern worth tackling.
4. **Hydration & fibre** are the low-hanging fruit for shifting toward Type 4; GutSpy’s daily goals keep you accountable.
5. **When to escalate:** Blood, black-tarry stools or persistent Types 1 or 7 call for medical review, no matter what the averages say.
